## What is DeathSwap?
DeathSwap is a game where two players duel it out,
trying to be the last one alive! Play begins with both players starting a fresh survival experience, thousands of blocks apart.
Every 5 minutes, the players will switch positions.
The aim is to put yourself in a position that would result in your opponent's death, should a swap occur.
It's that easy! Try to kill your opponent with a simple trap, like holding shift over lava, or with something more intricate... 
like lava and `TNT`!

## Important Depends
- ScoreFactory by Jack (`Virion`)
This is for the Scoreboard.
Make sure to install the Virion Plugin

## Soft Depends
- PureEntitiesX 
so you can have mobs spawn on the world and get the mob drops (ex: pearls, gunpowder etc)
- MultiWorld
so you can make custom generated worlds to player
